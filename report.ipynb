        "While Study I focused on how music changed, this section shifts to the economic side of the music industry. The COVID-19 pandemic was a health crisis, but it also caused a major shock to the economy.\n",
        "We wanted to investigate two main questions regarding the financial performance of the sector:\n",
        "\n",
        "* How were the stock prices of music streaming companies affected during the COVID-19 period?\n",
        "* Did Spotify's stock exhibit abnormal volatility or structural changes during the pandemic compared to before?\n",
        "\n",
        "We hypothesized that even if the content of the music (sentiment) stayed stable, the market valuation (stock price) would show distinct signs of instability and \"abnormal volatility\" due to the pandemic.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Around the start of the pandemic in early 2020, the pattern changes noticeably. The stock price increases rapidly and in a non-linear way, rising from roughly $150 to above $300 within about a year. This sharp shift suggests a structural break rather than a continuation of the earlier trend.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Seasonality: We thought maybe there would be a pattern, like sales going up every Christmas. However, if you examine the y-axis, the numbers are relatively small compared to the trend. The waves are present, but they do not significantly impact the price. This indicates that the substantial price jump was not due to the time of year.\n",
        "\n",

Models like ARIMA assume the data is stationary, which basically means the average and the spread of the data shouldn't change over time. However, looking at our stock price charts, the data clearly breaks this rule. It goes up and down wildly. So, we need to conduct a preprocessing step to make it stationary\n",

        "\n",
        "* ACF: The autocorrelation bars decay very slowly and stay outside the confidence bounds for many lags. This usually happens when the data is not stationary and shows strong persistence. In this case, the slow decay likely means that the overall trend is very strong and is affecting the series, making the short-term changes harder to see.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 1: Log-Transformation \n",
        "\n",
        "The first thing we noticed was the variance. There was a strange pattern here. When the stock price was low in 2018, the movements were pretty small. But once the price became much higher around 2020, the fluctuations also became much bigger.\n",

        "* The orange line is the log-transformed price. It looks much smoother and more consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Applying a logarithmic transformation reduces the impact of large values by compressing the scale of the data. Price movements are interpreted in relative terms rather than absolute dollar amounts, making the series more suitable for modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 2: First-Order Differencing\n",
        "\n",
        "At first glance (looking back at log transformation), the log-transformed data (orange line) might appear \"flat\" enough. However, this is deceptive. While the variance was stabilized, the series still retained a deterministic trend—the mean value was drifting upwards over time as the company grew. For an ARIMA model to be valid, the data must not just be stable in width, but also horizontal in direction (stationary mean).\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Unlike the log-series which drifted upwards, the differenced series oscillates consistently around zero.\n",
