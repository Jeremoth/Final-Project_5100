## Study II: Economic Volatility and Market Structural Change
**(研究二：经济波动与市场的结构性变化)**

### 4.1 Motivation and Research Questions
**(4.1 动机与研究问题)**

While Study I analyzed the internal evolution of musical sentiment, this section pivots to the external economic reality of the industry. The COVID-19 pandemic represented a massive external shock to the "stay-at-home" economy. Our investigation focuses on two specific research questions regarding the financial valuation of the sector:
1.  **How were the stock prices of music streaming companies affected during the COVID-19 period?**
2.  **Did streaming company stocks exhibit abnormal volatility or structural changes during the pandemic compared to the pre-COVID period?**

We hypothesized that unlike the content of the music—which Study I found to be relatively resilient—the market valuation of the platform (Spotify) would exhibit distinct non-stationary behavior, structural instability, and "abnormal volatility" driven by speculative investment during the pandemic.

### 4.2 Methodological Rationale and Data Transformation
**(4.2 方法论依据与数据变换)**

Building on the primary dataset described in Section 2, the financial time series required specific transformations to satisfy the stationarity assumptions of ARIMA modeling (Gaussian noise, constant variance).

**4.2.1 Diagnosing Heteroscedasticity**
Visual inspection of the raw monthly closing prices ($P_t$) revealed a massive structural break starting in Q1 2020. The price accelerated non-linearly from approximately $150 to over $300, creating a regime of "explosive behavior".

Critically, the series exhibited **heteroscedasticity** (changing variance over time). The variance of the stock price grew proportional to its level, a phenomenon known as the "magnitude effect." To address this, we applied a **Logarithmic Transformation**:
$$y_t = \ln(P_t)$$
This transformation stabilizes the variance and converts the series from absolute dollar values to relative returns. This is crucial for modeling the "pandemic bubble," as it allows us to treat percentage changes symmetrically rather than being skewed by the raw price spike.

**4.2.2 Removing Stochastic Trends**
Even after log-transformation, the series retained a strong deterministic trend driven by the market boom. To isolate the stochastic component (the "shocks"), we applied **First-Order Differencing**:
$$\Delta y_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$$
This converts the series into "log-returns," representing the month-over-month percentage change, which is the standard metric for financial time series analysis.

### 4.3 Analysis of Volatility and Structural Change
**(4.3 波动性与结构性变化的分析)**

To rigorously answer whether the stock exhibited "abnormal volatility," we employed both decomposition techniques and formal hypothesis testing.

**4.3.1 Decomposition and Volatility Clustering**
We performed an additive decomposition to separate the signal from the noise. The **residual component**—representing the irregularity remaining after trend and seasonality were removed—showed distinct clustering of large shocks starting in 2020. This validates the hypothesis of **"volatility clustering,"** a phenomenon where periods of high variance (the pandemic onset) are followed by further high variance. This distinguishes the COVID-19 era structurally from the stable growth period of 2018–2019.

**4.3.2 Formal Stationarity Test (ADF)**
We quantified this structural change using the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)** test. The results highlight the drastic nature of the market shift:

* **Pre-Transformation (Original Series):** The test statistic was $-1.96$ with a p-value of **$p \approx 0.304$**. We failed to reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$: Unit Root present). This confirms that the raw price was non-stationary and driven by a strong, unpredictable drift.
* **Post-Transformation (Log-Differenced):** The transformed series yielded a statistic of $-4.91$ and a highly significant p-value of **$p \approx 0.00003$**. This confirms that the series could be stabilized, but *only* after mathematically removing the massive trend component introduced by the pandemic.

### 4.4 ARIMA Modeling and Residual Diagnostics
**(4.4 ARIMA 建模与残差诊断)**

To quantify the market's behavior, we fit an **ARIMA(1, 1, 0)** model. This specification was selected based on a systematic grid search minimizing the **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**, which balances model fit against complexity.

**Table 1: Model Performance Comparison**
*(Comparison of candidate models based on AIC/BIC scores)*

| Model | Parameters (p,d,q) | AIC | BIC | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model A** | **(1, 1, 0)** | **-26.43** | **-23.12** | **Best Fit (Parsimonious)** |
| Model B | (1, 1, 1) | -24.89 | -20.55 | Overfitting (Redundant MA term) |
| Model C | (3, 1, 0) | -23.15 | -18.76 | Diminishing returns on higher lags |

The selection of ARIMA(1, 1, 0) indicates **"short memory"** in the market—prices were predictable in the very short term (1 month lag), but lacked long-term determinism.

**The Anatomy of Crisis: Residual Analysis**
However, the **Residual Diagnostics** provided the most definitive answer to our research question regarding structural change. While the model captured the mean trend, the errors revealed the limit of standard forecasting during a crisis:
1.  **Heavy Tails (Kurtosis):** The Normal Q-Q plot of the residuals showed significant deviations from the red line at the extremes. This "heavy-tailed" distribution indicates that the pandemic introduced "Black Swan" events—extreme price shocks that occurred far more frequently than a normal statistical distribution would predict.
2.  **High-Variance Regime:** The standardized residuals confirmed that while the pre-COVID period was homoscedastic (constant variance), the 2020-2021 period entered a high-variance regime that standard linear models interpret as statistical anomalies.

### 4.5 Conclusion: The Economic Impact
**(4.5 结论：经济影响)**

In answer to our specific research questions for Study II, the time series analysis confirms that the COVID-19 period fundamentally altered the behavior of Spotify’s stock price:

1.  **Effect on Price (Structural Break):** The pandemic acted as a catalyst for a regime shift, transforming the stock from a steady linear trend to an exponential growth phase that required logarithmic damping to model effectively.
2.  **Abnormal Volatility:** We found clear evidence of abnormal volatility. The clustering of large residuals in 2020 and the heavy-tailed distribution of errors confirm that the market valuation was highly sensitive to the external shock.

***Transition to Section 4.6:***
*Having quantified the structural instability and abnormal volatility in the financial valuation of the streaming industry, a critical question remains: Did this economic turbulence mirror a similar shift in the content being consumed? In the following section, we investigate the relationship (or lack thereof) between these financial shocks and the emotional sentiment of the music itself.*
