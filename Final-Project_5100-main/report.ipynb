All these features were recorded in the dataset, which represents the daily rankings of the most consumed songs found in the world. To decrease background noise and focus on the broad trends, we organized daily observations into monthly values which facilitate an accurate and consistent temporal comparison between pre-COVID, COVID, and post-COVID periods.\n",

        "While Study I focused on how music changed, this section shifts to the economic side of the music industry. The COVID-19 pandemic was a health crisis, but it also caused a major shock to the economy.\n",
        "We wanted to investigate two main questions regarding the financial performance of the sector:\n",
        "\n",
        "* How were the stock prices of music streaming companies affected during the COVID-19 period?\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Around the start of the pandemic in early 2020, the pattern changes noticeably. The stock price increases rapidly and in a non-linear way, rising from roughly $150 to above $300 within about a year. This sharp shift suggests a structural break rather than a continuation of the earlier trend.\n",

        "\n",
        "After examining the trend, we knew the price had increased, but we needed to know how it went up. Was it just a normal seasonal thing? Or was something broken? To figure this out, we used decomposition.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Seasonality: We thought maybe there would be a pattern, like sales going up every Christmas. However, if you examine the y-axis, the numbers are relatively small compared to the trend. The waves are present, but they do not significantly impact the price. This indicates that the substantial price jump was not due to the time of year.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Residuals: In a healthy market, residual should be small and randomly scattered around zero. However, upon inspecting the bottom panel, we see a distinct cluster of huge spikes starting in 2020.\n",
        "\n",
        "Seeing those big, clustered spikes in the bottom graph proves that the market was not stable. This gave us the proof we needed to say that the volatility was abnormal during COVID.\n",

Models like ARIMA assume the data is stationary, which basically means the average and the spread of the data shouldn't change over time. However, looking at our stock price charts, the data clearly breaks this rule. It goes up and down wildly. So, we need to conduct a preprocessing step to make it stationary\n",

        "* ACF: The autocorrelation bars decay very slowly and stay outside the confidence bounds for many lags. This usually happens when the data is not stationary and shows strong persistence. In this case, the slow decay likely means that the overall trend is very strong and is affecting the series, making the short-term changes harder to see.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 1: Log-Transformation \n",
        "\n",
        "The first thing we noticed was the variance. There was a strange pattern here. When the stock price was low in 2018, the movements were pretty small. But once the price became much higher around 2020, the fluctuations also became much bigger.\n",

        "\n",
        "Applying a logarithmic transformation reduces the impact of large values by compressing the scale of the data. Price movements are interpreted in relative terms rather than absolute dollar amounts, making the series more suitable for modeling.\n",

        "#### Step 2: First-Order Differencing\n",
        "\n",
        "At first glance (looking back at log transformation), the log-transformed data (orange line) might appear \"flat\" enough. However, this is deceptive. While the variance was stabilized, the series still retained a deterministic trend—the mean value was drifting upwards over time as the company grew. For an ARIMA model to be valid, the data must not just be stable in width, but also horizontal in direction (stationary mean).\n",

        "Unlike the log-series which drifted upwards, the differenced series oscillates consistently around zero.\n",
